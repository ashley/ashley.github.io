				<h2>GoBikes</h2>
				<img src="../images/project-1-1.png">
				<h3>Overview</h3>
				<p>GoBikes is a web app that allows students of Olin College of Engineering to rent bikes. The design allows for a quick view of bikes that are ready to rent and bikes that are broken and in the garage. Students are accounted for based on their college email address. This means students can ping another student if a bike is overdue.Students can also report broken bikes, which would automatically send a notification to the repair shop.</p>
				<br>
				<h3>Inspiration</h3>
				<p>GoBikes was inspired by the problem of an online rental system for bikes at the Olin College of Engineering. Students were dissatisfied with the treatment and organization of the on-campus bike rental. In fact, the rental system was solely a paper on a clipboard which hung from the ceiling of the garage. My team and I wanted a simple but accessible web app that would allow the college to manage bike rentals through an online database. </p>
				<br>
				<h3>Brainstorm and Design</h3>
				<p>We saw the need for a web app because most students would be using a mobile platform to access the databse. Although making a mobile application would be more logical, the team and I decided to build a native web app rather than an iOS app and Android app.<br><br>We decided to use solid red, yellow, and green colors to represent the status of the bike. The simplicity of using these colors has enchanced the style and accessibility of GoBikes.</p>
				<br>
				<h3>Built with HTML, CSS, and Javascript</h3>
				<p>Because none of us had any exposure to Node.js, Ruby on Rails, or Django, we decided to build GoBikes using local variable in Javascript. The team and I wanted to prioritize the design and usefulness by learning how we can use HTML and CSS to enhance the appearance and user experience of GoBikes. We ended up using a building a lightbox window so that when a user clicks on a bike, a lightbox window would appear. The color or the bike status is also controlled by Javascript. When a bike is checkedout, the class of the div is changed to red status. This is how we incorporate Javascript into GoBikes.</p>
				<h3>Top Five Finalists and Groupon Prize</h3>
				<p>This was my first hackathon where I was able to code something for my project! We realized that the idea of GoBikes could be used for any kind of rental item. This gave us some leverage during demos, and ultimately, we were picked as one of the Top Five Finalists and were awarded the Groupon Prize!</p>
